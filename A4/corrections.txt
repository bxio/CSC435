Corrections
===========

1. In file LLVM.cs, the line
     Debug.Assert(suspensionCnt==0);
   should be deleted or commented out. (Line # 79.)
   [Corrected: 13:55, 14 July.]

2. In file CbTypeCheckVisitor2.cs, the case for the Index tag
   needs to include the assignment
         node.Kind = CbKind.Variable;
   Inserting this just before the break at line 305 is OK.
   [Corrected: 15 July.]

3. Several corrections/improvements have been made to these files:
      LLVMVisitor2.cs
      LLVM-Definitions.cs
      LLVM-WriteMethods.cs
      LLVM.cs
      CbTypeCheckVisitor2.cs
      cbc.cs
   and there is one new source code file named:
      LLVM-Arrays.cs
   The improvements are to provide support for arrays in Cb. The
   methods which generate LLVM code for array access are provided
   in the new file.
   The corrections fix issues involving
      use of an implicit this pointer when calling a method in same class
      accessing fields in the current instance (with implicit this pointer)
      LLVM code not quite correct for a 64 bit processor

   Note: a test program 'ArrayTestingWithFibs.cs' has been provided to
   demonstrate array access working.

4. In file LLVM-UtilityMethods.cs, line 125 in the WriteIntInst method
   should be
    	case NodeType.Div: op = "sdiv"; break;
