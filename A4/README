Creating the executable
========================

1. Assuming you have generated the lexer and parser already (CbLexer.cs and CbParser.cs), run the build file to create a cbc.exe, which will generate your LL file (your IR code). Ensure you have the ShiftReduceParser.dll before running the build.bat file.

2. Next, you want to SSH into a lab computer and then run the gen.sh script remotely to generate the executable for the test program. You should end up with a binary named Fibs.

3. To run "Fibs", you have to run it via SSH by using 

% ./Fibs 

in the local directory.
