
The text below the double horizontal line shows approximately what
the output is expected to be when the nametable is printed after the
sample program CbExample.cs (in the Assignment 1 materials) is
processed. Some extra blank lines have been inserted for readability.

The nested namespace System is created by initialization code in
CbType.cs.  It therefore contains datatype information for the
methods and members in the classes defined in System.

Information about the other classes and their members is inserted into
the top-level symbol table by your visitor code for part 2 of assign-
ment 2. It does not include datatype information for methods and
members.

Notes:

1. The parent of each class is often shown as "null". That indicates no
parent was specified in the declaration of the class.  In practice,
every such class has 'Object' as its parent. We will fill in the
reference to Object only in Assignment 3, though.

2. The formatting of the output could be made a lot nicer. Let's not
worry about that until the next assignment.

3. The entire Cb program is contained inside a namespace whose name
   is "" (the empty string). That should explain the first line dis-
   played below.
