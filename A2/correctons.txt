Corrections  and Clarifications

1. When building the top-level symbol table, information entered for members
   of classes does not include any datatype information at this time. (Such
   information cannot be completely entered because we don't know what all
   the classes are in the program.)
   A null pointer can be used instead of any type descriptor reference when
   creating a descriptor for a class member. Similarly null can be used
   instead of a list for a method's argument types.
   Adding in all the missing information and the type checking will be a
   big component of Assignment 3. For know, we need to know only the names
   of class members, what kind of member they are, and for a method whether
   it is static or not static (both virtual and override mean not static).

***

This list is likely to grow as questions are asked and issues are found
with the assignment specification.
