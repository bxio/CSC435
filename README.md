CSC435 Summer 2014 Repository
========
This is the repository for Computer Science 435: Compiler Construction course at UVic over Summer 2013. Both members of this team received A's in the course.

Our code is all here, commented and everything. Answers to the questions asked by the professor is not included, in case you take the course with the same professor.

Despite the code you get in this repo, compiler construction is still quite difficult and will definitely take some time to wrap your head around. Start your assignment early. Good luck.

##Questions?
Create an issue! I usually respond to all the ones I find interesting. Correct responses to questions will cost $$$.
